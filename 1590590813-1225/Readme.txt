The source and resources for the sample game from Introduction to 3D game Engine Design is packaged in two files.  be sure to douwnload and unzip both.  There are issues in the car physics code that were discovered after the book was printed.  Although some of the issues have been addressed and the car is now driveable there will be additional corrections coming in the next week or so.  

Check back for updated files in the Apress download site or at http://home.stny.rr.com/lynnharrison.  I can be contacted on the Apress forum at www.forums.apress.com on the game development forum.

The SampleGame solution file is the primary solution for the game project.  It includes the other solutions as sub-projects.  They build DLLs that are used by the game application.
